And Quarto will only carry through things into the rendered/previewed version if they are read by Quarto.\n\nAs an example, I chose to style an image in the markdown, using HTML:\n\n``` HTML\n<div style=\t\t\n    \"background-image: url(portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg);\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 400px;\n    background-position: 50% 40%;\n    background-size: cover;\">\n</div>\n```\n\nbut the image was not carried through into the rendered version so failed to display.\n\nTo solve this I called the image in simple markdown, but managed to apply inline CSS styling too.\n\n``` Markdown\n![](portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg){style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: center;\"}\n```\n\n",
