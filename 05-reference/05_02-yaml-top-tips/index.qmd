Try to avoid using HTML code in your markdown, only because Quarto won't read the HTML when it is rendering. And Quarto will only carry through things into the rendered/previewed version if they are read by Quarto.

As an example, I chose to style an image in the markdown, using HTML:

``` HTML
<div style=		
    "background-image: url(portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg);
    width: 100%;
    height: 400px;
    background-position: 50% 40%;
    background-size: cover;">
</div>
```

but the image was not carried through into the rendered version so failed to display.

To solve this I called the image in simple markdown, but managed to apply inline CSS styling too.

``` Markdown
![](portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg){style="height: 400px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: center;"}
```

For some reason having 

``` yaml
jupyter: python3
```

in the Yaml causes Quarto to make a '_files' folder mirroring the file/folder with the jupyter: python3 Yaml in. This mirror folder contains execute files, probably letting Quarto know what to run in python or something. Essentially, I am a bit unsure about this Yaml.
