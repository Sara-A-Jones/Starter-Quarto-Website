Maybe related to markdown.\nCHATGPT: The “:::” is often used in markdown as a way to create a horizontal rule, which is a line that separates content on a webpage or document. It is used to visually break up sections of content and make them easier to read. It is supported by many markdown parsers and can be used in many different platforms like Github, Jupyter notebook, etc.\nME: is it related to breaks between cells in notebooks?\nCHATGPT: No, the “:::” is not typically used to indicate breaks between cells in notebooks. Notebooks, such as Jupyter, use specific syntax to separate code cells, such as using “—” or “***” in markdown cells or using “#%%” in code cells.\nIt’s not a standard syntax, but some people use it as a way to separate cells in jupyter notebook but it is not officially supported and different from the standard way which is using the command “—” or “***” in markdown cell or using “#%%” in code cells.\n\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n\nAuthoring - Article Layout\n\n.column-body-outset\n.column-page-inset\n.column-page\n.column-screen-inset\n.column-screen\n\n\n\n\nalso can put direction on the end -right or -left.\nUsing the margin:\n\ncan put footnotes, citations and asides in the margin too.\ncan also put like figures and stuff in the margin.\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html\n\n\nNavigation\n\nOverview\nTop Navigation\nSide Navigation\nHybrid Navigation\nPage Navigation\nPage Footer\nHiding Navigation\nReader Mode\nSite Search\nGitHub Links\nRedirects\n404 Pages\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html\n\n\nDocument Listings (make a structured list of things on a web page)\n\nListing Contents (a whole folder, or specific files/folders)\nListing Options\n\nDefault\nGrids\nTables\n\nUser Tools\n\nSorting dropdown\nFiltering dropdown\nPagination (showing a finite number pf posts at once and splitting the list of posts over multiple pages)\n\nListing Location (e.g. listing sandwiched between texts)\n\nMultiple Listings\n\nListing Fields (e.g. [image, date, title, author, reading-time])\n\nCustomizing Fields\n\nListing Sorting and Tags\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html\n\n\nExtra on Listings\n\nListing templates (In addition to the 3 built in types of listings can make custom listings)\nDealing with listing metadata and customising it\nPoints to the gallery to show examples of quarto websites\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings-custom.html\n\n\nPage Layout\n\npage-layout (article, full, custom)\n\nin custom, can make grid with different column widths\n\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/page-layout.html#custom\n\n\nThemes\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html\n\n\nExtra Website Things\n\nHeaders & Footers\nSocial Metadata\nGoogle Analytics\nCookie Consent\nSite Resources\nDark Mode\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html\n\n\nHow .yml files and headers combine\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html\n\n\nProcessing foreign notebooks into a good format\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/extensions/nbfilter.html\n\n\nInteractivity (e.g. sliders on plots)\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/interactive/"

    "text": "Try to avoid using HTML code in your markdown, only because Quarto won’t read the HTML when it is rendering. And Quarto will only carry through things into the rendered/previewed version if they are read by Quarto.\nAs an example, I chose to style an image in the markdown, using HTML:\n<div style=     \n    \"background-image: url(portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg);\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 400px;\n    background-position: 50% 40%;\n    background-size: cover;\">\n</div>\nbut the image was not carried through into the rendered version so failed to display.\nTo solve this I called the image in simple markdown, but managed to apply inline CSS styling too.\n![](portfolio_diego-ph-fIq0tET6llw-unsplash.jpg){style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: center;\"}"
