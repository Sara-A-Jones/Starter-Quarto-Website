::: {#about-page}

I am currently creating a website using a template as a starting point. 

#### Things to Consider
- Purpose and goals
- Target audience and user experience
- Design and layout
- Content and information

#### Outcomes
I hope to establish a digital presence that includes:

- An overview of my work
- An online portfolio
- A summary of papers I've read
- A list of guides
- A journal of events I attended
- A blog

#### Influences
My website project has been influenced by other professional websites, design trends, feedback and my personal style.
